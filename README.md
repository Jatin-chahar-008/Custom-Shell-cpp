# Custom Shell in C++ with Custom Vector and Map

This project showcases:
* Custom Vector Template (Vector<T>): A dynamic array implementation from scratch.
* Custom Map Template (Map<K, V>): A key-value storage system based on a self-balanced Red-Black Tree.
* Custom Shell: A C++ program capable of executing Linux commands directly from the terminal.
  
All components are entirely self-implemented in C++, aiming to enhance the understanding of data structures and system-level programming.
